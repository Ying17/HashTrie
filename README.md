# HashTrie
We present an efficiency-optimized functional HashTrie algorithm and mechanically validate it.

HashTrie.thy contains the functional modeling and mechanical validation of the algorithm;

HashTrie_TM.thy contains the temporal model and validation of the related time complexity;

Multi_Pattern_Matching.thy contains the work on selecting the Multi Pattern Matching algorithm as an example of the application.
